# AI Disclosure: This Project's Genesis

This entire project, including its documentation and code structure, has been intentionally designed and developed using **AI agents operating within a Command-Line Interface (CLI)**.

The purpose of this approach is to serve as a practical, real-world demonstration of the Non-General AI (NGAI) philosophy and use case. Each file, every line of documentation, and the overall architecture are artifacts generated through a continuous conversation and collaboration between a human operator and specialized AI agents.

This project embodies the core principle that an AI, when equipped with specific "meta-skills" (like those defined in `make_agent.json` and `make_agent_qc.json`), can become a highly efficient and purpose-built specialist. By guiding these agents through a structured, conversational workflow, complex development tasks can be streamlined, allowing the human to focus on higher-level design and validation rather than boilerplate creation.

This is not merely a collection of files; it is a testament to the power of AI-assisted development in a CLI environment, showcasing how focused AI agents can accelerate the creation of robust and well-documented software.
